# PROJECT-CoffeNar-oldstyle
This was my very first front-end project — a non-responsive, experimental layout built entirely with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of jQuery.  It’s not perfect (not even responsive!), but it was my starting point in web development.  I’m keeping it here as a memory of where I began  ✨
